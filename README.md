1. Investigate Blockchain Principles (5 points):
According to technical definition, Blockchain is a peer-to-peer, distributed ledger that is cryptographically secure, append-only, immutable (extremely hard to change), and updateable only via consensus among peers. The main principles of the blockchain are:

   1.1 Distribution: Participants on a network are physically apart but connected. Each maintains a complete ledger.

   1.2 Encryption: Blockchain uses private and public keys for secure, semi-anonymous data recording, allowing control over personal information.

   1.3 Immutability: Transactions are signed, time-stamped, and added in order, preventing corruption without consensus.

   1.4 Tokenization:  Secure value exchange with tokens representing assets or data, empowering data control.

   1.5 Decentralization: No single entity controls network info or rules; nodes maintain them through consensus.
